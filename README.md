# CatBoost-in-Python-ML

CatBoost is a machine learning algorithm that uses gradient boosting on decision trees. It is available as an open source library.It is a powerfull library build by Yandex community. This note book deals with indepth understanding of how to implement the catboost algorithm on the data and improving the accuracy of the model.

Main advantages of CatBoost:
  - Superior quality when [compared](https://github.com/catboost/benchmarks/blob/master/README.md) with other GBDT libraries on many datasets.
  - Best in class [prediction](https://catboost.ai/docs/concepts/c-plus-plus-api.html) speed.
  - Support for both [numerical and categorical](https://catboost.ai/docs/concepts/algorithm-main-stages.html) features.
  - Fast GPU and multi-GPU support for training out of the box.
  - Visualization tools [included](https://catboost.ai/docs/features/visualization.html).
